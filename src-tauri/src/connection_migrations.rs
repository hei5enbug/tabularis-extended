/// standalone PostgreSQL plugin, id `"postgresql"`) offered MySQL-style
/// underscored `ssl_mode` values instead of Postgres-style hyphenated ones.
/// The plugin's own TLS check only recognizes the hyphenated spelling, so a
/// connection saved with the wrong-family value connects in cleartext with no
/// error. Fixing the dropdown only stops *new* saves from getting the wrong
/// value — this rewrites values already persisted before the fix shipped.

/// if it changed since this function's own read, the migration is skipped
/// for this run rather than overwritten. This is safe because the migration
